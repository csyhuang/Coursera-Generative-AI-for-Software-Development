# Question 1

Which of these is the best definition of “Generative AI”?


- [ ] Artificial intelligence systems that can map from an input A to an output B.
- [ ] A form of web search 
- [x] AI that can produce high quality content, such as text, images, and audio.
- [ ] Any web-based application that generates text


# Question 2
A computer vision system “sees” objects in the same way that a living creature does.

- [ ] True
- [x] False


# Question 3
How does machine learning differ from traditional programming paradigms?


- [x] Machine learning derives rules from data and known answers, rather than explicitly coding rules.
- [ ] Machine learning doesn’t require any input data, while traditional programming always uses data
- [ ] Machine learning uses robots to write code instead of human programmers.
- [ ] Machine learning requires determining complex sets of rules before writing any computer programs


# Question 4
Machine learning is an iterative process. Which of the following are steps that you’ll carry out during a machine learning project?


- [ ] If your data is labeled, remove the labels to ensure that information does not affect the process of training the model
- [x] Write a program that makes an initial guess about the nature of the relationship between the data and their labels
- [x] Optimize your guess by learning from examples where the model could not predict the label of the input data
- [ ] Provide the machine learning model with explicit rules that it should use to make predictions


# Question 5
Which of the following day-to-day software development tools have some Generative AI integrations powering them?


- [ ] File managers like File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS)
- [x] Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- [x] Search engines
- [x] Debugging tools
